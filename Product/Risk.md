# Risk

1. Market Risk : is the problem worth solving ? sometimes it's not possible to know if enough people actually have this problem or need deeply enough.

2. Value Risk: is our solution actually valuable? sometimes it's not possible to know if the solution we have in mind will actually be sufficiently valuable at solving the problem.

3. Feasibility Risk: is the solution feasible?** ** sometimes it's not possible to know if a problem is actually <solvable> within the boundaries of non-fungibles like physics & economics

4. Execution Risk:  sometimes it's not clear if a certain set of people can focus & deliver a solution with the resources, time and people that they have

Managing Market Risk: this is often about having the market research understand work done a-priori to know that this problem is a real, happening to a large enough set of people, frequently enough. Sometimes the market research means looking at competitors, and sometimes it could mean looking for emergent behavior in existing products. There are few things worse for a product team than to build a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.  This rarely needs engineering resources.

Managing Value Risk: sometimes we build solutions to people problems that  aren't actually much better than known alternatives. For utilities,  where cost dominates the value function in $ and time - ie Uber, WhatsApp etc.) this can be easy to articulate, but for other kinds of products this can be harder since the competition is in-direct (ie FB  vs. myspace, but also vs. email/AIM) . Getting extremely crisp & being very real about why the solution we propose is an order magnitude better than current alternatives and working with real users & data is often the key to managing the risk here.

Managing Feasibility Risk : is about doing our homework and the appropriate R&D to identify if the space of valuable solutions that we are contemplating are even plausible. Either physically (ie don't violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics), or economically (ie unit economics converge to cost < value in some clear path, sufficient underlying margin in the e2e system).

Managing Execution Risk: is often about ensuring highly focused teams with the right people are given tightly defined goals, quickly iterative measurement systems and explicitly given sufficient resources and <insufficient> time.

MR. ELON MUSK
An example that is useful is to also think about is Elon Musk's "big ideas" . These often tend to be Execution Risks, even though they appear at first glance to be Feasibility Risks - there is actually a TON of foundational work his team does beforehand to ensure that the problems worked on are actually tractable within the bounds of physics & economics. He also manages Market & Value Risk very aggressively (ie high end super cars for Tesla first where he knows there is need, and govt contracts for Space X) - in both cases he is often cost-cutting / or value-adding at an order of magnitude of more. It is often absolutely clear that the problems Elon works on are problems <worth solving>, and the solutions are <much better>
